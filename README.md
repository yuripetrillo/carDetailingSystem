# Car Detailing Management System

Welcome to the Car Detailing Management System, a web application designed to streamline order management for a specialized car detailing service company. In this comprehensive guide, you'll find an in-depth overview and detailed instructions on running the application.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

### Project Overview

My Car Detailing Management System satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements by offering a tailored solution for managing car detailing orders. Unlike generic projects, this application focuses on a specific industry, providing a unique user experience for automotive enthusiasts and delves deep into the specific needs of a car detailing business, ensuring a unique and purpose-built service.
The main distinctive feature of the project is the personalized orders section which, through svg-based graphics, allows a selection of the parts of the car to be treated in a graphic and interactive way which intelligently allows you to select, for example, both sides if you select elements that are not decoupled like the front wheels.
It allows you to change your choices at any time even after the first choice of vehicle and in the event of involuntary closing of the page a prompt is shown to ensure that you really want to lose the order during creation.

### Distinctiveness Criteria

1. **Industry Focus:** Addressing the unique requirements, this project of car detailing system application, stands out from generalized applications, providing a specialized service without relying on previous projects.

2. **Independence:** It is entirely independent, not derived from existing projects, ensuring originality and uniqueness.

3. **Non-Social Network like:** While incorporating messaging features, the application is not a social network. Instead, it serves as a practical tool for managing car detailing orders/informations.
The messaging system allows customers to communicate with the company directly, and they have their personal area with entry and exit boxes from which they can also check any notifications marked with a red badge in case of unread messages.

4. **Differentiation from E-commerce Site:** Although resembling an e-commerce setup, the project is distinct because it focuses on services rather than physical products, and customization is tailored to car detailing specifics.

### Technical Complexity

1. **Django and JavaScript Utilization:** The project leverages Django on the backend and utilizes multiple models to manage orders and car data. JavaScript, instead, enhances the frontend interactivity, ensuring an engaging user experience.

2. **Mobile-Responsiveness:** The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on various devices.
